# Repository of the Actionable FAIR4RS Task Force presentation material for the BOSC 2025 conference (July 21-22 2025)

## About

This repository contains the material and information associated with our talk at the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) 2025. We are introducing the Actionable Guidelines for FAIR Research Software (Actionable FAIR4RS) Task Force. The Task Force was initiated in December 2024 under the Research Software Alliance (ReSA) and is aiming to build upon our FAIR Biomedical Research Software (FAIR-BioRS) guidelines and establish actionble guidelines for making any research software FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) in line with the FAIR4RS principles.

Abstract: 
The Research Software Alliance (ReSA) has established a Task Force dedicated to translating the FAIR Principles for Research Software (FAIR4RS Principles) into practical, actionable guidelines. Existing field-specific actionable guidelines, such as the FAIR Biomedical Research Software (FAIR-BioRS) guidelines (presented first during BOSC 2022), lack cross-discipline community input. The Actionable Guidelines for FAIR Research Software Task Force, formed in December 2024, brings together a diverse team of research software developers to address this gap. The Task Force is using the FAIR-BioRS guidelines as a foundation to build upon while aiming to create generalized guidelines. The Task Force began by analyzing the FAIR4RS Principles, where it identified six key requirement categories: Identifiers, Metadata for software publication and discovery, Standards for inputs/outputs, Qualified references, Metadata for software reuse, and License. To address these requirements, six sub-groups are conducting literature reviews and community outreach to define actionable practices for each category. Some of the challenges include identifying suitable identifiers, archival repositories, and metadata standards across research domains. This presentation provides an overview of the Task Force, presents its current progress, and outlines opportunities for community involvement. We will also explain how the FAIR-BioRS guidelines have now led to this global effort. The Task Force is dedicated to making all its outcomes openly available (CC-BY-4.0 license). This initiative will significantly benefit the biomedical open-source community by providing generalized guidelines to make software FAIR that applies beyond just biomedical software, which is critical to prevent siloed practices and drive cross-discipline collaborations.
